In the present competitive scenario a need has been felt to facilitate Micro and Small Enterprises to market their goods / services individually or collectively through ‘Consortium’. Accordingly, the scheme for promoting the products of the MSEs has been reviewed in 2011 & named as “Consortia and Tender Marketing Scheme”. This scheme will especially help the units to enlist themselves for participating in Govt. /private tenders. Special features of the Scheme: The scheme will cover Micro & Small Enterprises registered with National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) under its Single Point Registration Scheme (SPRS).

The scheme inter alia includes the procedures for formation of Consortium, Capacity Building of MSEs by formation of consortia of the units manufacturing similar products, participation in tenders on behalf of units in a ‘consortia’ to secure orders in ‘bulk’ quantities, distribution of orders amongst units in a ‘consortia’ as per their capacities, facilitate the ‘consortia’ members in meeting their raw materials requirements & facilitating ‘Credit’ for the supplies made.
